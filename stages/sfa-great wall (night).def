[Info]
name = "SFA Great Wall (Night) - Chun-Li Stage"
; From the CPS2 game Street Fighter Alpha.
; Converted for Mugen versions 2001.11.01 and up by Winane.
; (Also mostly compatible with Mugen version 04.14.2001.)
; Site:  http://www.mugenguild.net/~winane/
;
; Feel free to do whatever the heck you want with this stage,
; just so long as it doesn't piss off Capcom too much.
; But if you choose to put this stage on your site, please
; make sure your site always has the most recent version.

; By default, this stage has the same width and height as the original version.  But if you want
; to make it wider, you can set boundleft and boundright as high as -243 and 243 respectively.
; And you can raise boundhigh as high as you want.  But if you want to raise it by more than 40,
; be sure to remove the semicolon in front of the "tile = 0,8" line below.

; Credit and thanks to:
;  Capcom, of course, to whom most of the credit for this stage should go.
;  Elecbyte, of course, for Mugen, Sprmaker, and their documentation.
;  Razoola/CPS-2 Shock, for decrypting all those ROMs.
;  ElSemi, for Nebula.
;  Irfan Skiljan for IrfanView, Microsoft for Paint, and Jasc Software for Paint Shop Pro.
;  Valodim and Shin ShadowH, for the web space.
;  Dark Saviour, for providing the music from the PSX version of SFA.

; In the original game, these values vary from character to character.
; If you want to set them accurately for Chun-Li, based on pixel count, set both values to 24.
; If you want to set them accurately for Chun-Li, based on proportionality, set both values to 20.
